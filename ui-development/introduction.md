- Enable user to change what they see (interaction, **difficult**)

## The four hard parts

- efficient

## Principle of Engineering

### Analytical problem solving

Can you break down complex challenges and develop a strategy for solving the problem?

### Technical communication

Can I implement your approach from your explanation?

### Engineering approach

How you handle 'not knowing', debugging, code structure and working w/ docs.

### Non-technical communication

Empathetic and thoughtful communication, supportive approach.

### JavaScript and programming experience

Concepts like closure & data structures, state & view.

Almost every piece of technology needs a visual 'user interface' (UI)
