# Nouns

Nouns are the words that name people, places, organisations and things.
Style and grammer support how people interpret nouns in content.

## Proper nouns are the names of people and specific things

Any name for a specific person, organisation, place or thing is a 'proper noun'.

Proper nouns always start with capital letters,
except for some commercial terms.

> Example.
> June
> Shark Bay
> Collingwood Football Club
> Torres Strait Regional Authority
> Prime Minister of Australia

There are specific capitalisation conventions for the:

- titles of office holders
- names of organisations
- government terms

## Common nouns are words for generic things

Common nouns describe people, places, times or things in a general sense.
They have a capital letter only when they are the first word in sentence.

> Example.
> month
> coast
> local government
> prime ministers

Capitalise nouns only if they are part of a proper nouns.
Don't capitalise them if you use them as common nouns.

> Example.
> The ACT's Office of the Commissioner for the Environment
> was the first such agency in Australia. ('Office' is part of the formal title.)
>
> I worked in the office for 11 years.
> ('Office' is not part of the formal title,
> even if it refers to the Office of the Commissioner for the Environment.)

## Common nouns can be concrete or abstract

Concrete nouns name things you can identify through one or more of the 5 senses.

> Example.
> server
> phone
> software
> person

Abstract nouns name intangible things.
These include ideas, emotions and physical feelings.

> Example.
> honesty
> reliance
> engagement
> admiration

Some nouns can be either concrete or abstract, depending on the context.

> Example.
> The office is upstairs. (Concrete noun)
> Alfred Deakin was the first to hold the office of Attorney-General in Australia. (Abstract noun)

## Verbal nouns are also called 'gerunds'

Gerunds are nouns that form by attaching an '-ing' to a verb.

> Example.
> meet (verb), meeting (noun)
> report (verb), reporting (noun)

You can combine gerunds and other verbal nonus with a determiner (such as 'my' or 'your').

> Example.
> Your writing has improved. ('Your' is the determiner; 'writing' is the noun; 'has improved' is the verb.)
> They resent Bill's laughing at them.
> ('Bill's' is the determiner; 'resent' is the verb; 'laughing' is the noun.)

Verbal nouns also include nouns that related to verbs in another way.
For example, the noun can form by adding other types of suffix
to a verb like '-ation' or '-ment'. These are not gerunds.

> Example.
> fixation (Noun related to the verb 'fix')
> attachment (Noun related to the verb 'attach')

Other verbal nouns don't have any suffix but have the same spelling as the verb.
It is context that gives the distinction.

> Example.
> 'fix the issue' (verb), 'a quick fix' (noun)
> 'report an issue' (verb), 'annual report to the minister' (noun)

## Nouns can be singular or plural

Nouns can be singular or plural.
Most English words add an '-s' or '-es' to form the plural, but there are many exceptions.
Check a dictionary if you're not sure.

> Example.
> a computer, many computers
> a policy, many policies
> the standby, many standbys
> the Attorney-General, many attorneys-general

Some nouns don't change to form the plural.

> Example.
> an aircraft, many aircraft.

Don't use an apostrophe before (or after) the 's' to show the plural.

> Correct
> Adjust the desks and chairs.

> Incorrect
> Adjust the desk's and chair's

## Collective nouns describe a group in a single word

Collective nouns are a type of common noun.
They label groups of people or things.

> Example.
> crowd
> committee
> cluster (for example, of desks)

### Subject-verb agreement

A collective noun usually has a singular verb.
This is so, even if it's made up of component parts.

> Correct
> The government intends to act.
> The committee is meeting.

> Incorrect
> The government intend to act.
> The committee are meeting.

An exception is when you need to draw attention
to the individual parts of the collective noun.

> Example.
> The branch meets once a week.
> ('The branch', as a whole, meets once a week. The singular form of the verb is used.)
>
> The branch are divided over the new meeting schedule.
> (The individuals in 'the branch' have different opinions about the new meeting schedule.
> The plural form of the verb is used.)
