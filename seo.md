### Businesses with a Physical Location

- Submit your business to local directories - https://moz.com/local
- Correct errors/outdated information in Local Citations
- Acquire local backlinks - vendors, partners, local NGOs etc
- Set specific geographic-targeting in Google Search Console

### Page Rank

- Underlying assumption: "quality" of a site is proportional to the number of links to it
  if you're an important site,
  your links are worth more in terms of boosting the importance of other sites.
  if you frequently link to other sites,
  your links are worth less as influenced boosters.
  compared to important sites that hardly ever link at all.

  **note**
  for SEO,
  it's better to put product in one domain rather than different domain,
  because value will split out.

- The value of a link on a "quality site" is worth more

### Long Tail Keywords

- "learn javascript" vs "SEO metadata video course"
  low intent keyword vs high intent keyword
- Keyword phrases which are very, very specific to whatever you are selling
- Site visitors are more likely to use when they're closer to a point-of-purchase
