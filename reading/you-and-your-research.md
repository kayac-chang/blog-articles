# You and Your Research

Whoever has will be given more,
And they will have an abundance.
Whoever does not have,
Even what they have will be taken from them.

Once famous it's very easy remain famous.
Once not famous, what you do will be taken away from you.

It's necessary to do something outstanding,
otherwise what you do is sort of taken away from you.

Doing something significant by your definition.

You prepare yourself, and then luck hits you.
But there's lots of ways luck can hit you.

The very able people work very hard all the time.
They were at the problem all the time.

A prophet is not honored in his own country.
It will be often true that your local people cannot see that
you are doing great work.

The most important thing about great people
is they believe they can do great work.

I ain't scared of nothing.

If what you're working on is not important
and it's not likely to lead to important things,
why are you working on it?

The one man who could hear
"if what you were doing is not important not liking important
why are you doing it"
the one man who could, did become important.

If you don't work on important problems,
you are not going to do important things.

They can also only work on important problems,
and as a result they don't do anything.

You have to work on a problem
which can become important and matter,
which have a future,
which will grow into mighty oak tree.

When you get famous,
you get put on all kinds of committees and other things.
You can't get any work done.

Confidence is important.
Over-confidence is of course a disaster.

I've seen a lot of people abandon a good idea too soon.
I've seen people cling to a bad idea too long.
They're both difficult problems.

One of the features which you can cling to regularly
is a desire to do excellent work.
Whatever you do you're going to do well.

When you have a vision, you will go a long way.

Those who have the door open may very well know what's important.

What you think are the ideal working conditions, are not.

Frequently when you think things are wrong
and you haven't got the wherewithal to do,
it if you turn the problem around you can turn into great success.

You can change the conditions that you have to make success
either by inverting the problem or as I told you a second story
changing the nature problem
and recognizing the underlying real problem.

You should study your success, you don't study your failures.

We can work a hell of a lot harder than we have been.
Let me reorganize out life.

The race is not to the swiftest.
The guy who works hardest doesn't win.
The person who works on the right problem at the right time in the right way is what counts and nothing else.

I used to set aside Friday afternoon for "great thoughts".
I spent 10 percent of my time trying to answer the question:
what are the important problems of my field?
10 percent Friday afternoon straight through.

I recommend you find a regular time to stop and think:
what are the important things?
what is going on?
what is the nature of what you are doing?
what is the characteristic of the job?
what are the fundamentals behind it?

I've regularly tried to stress the bigger picture.
I've tried to stress fundamentals.
I've also stressed a necessity of learning new things.
You have to understand what is relevant to my field,
and what is interesting but is not relevant.

The importance of a problem to a great extent depends upon,
"have you got a way of attacking the problem"?

The most important thing that makes a problem important
is that there is an attack.
You have an idea how I can go about that problem.

The economic consequences are unbelievably large
but they're not important problems
until you have an idea how to do it.

It is not what you do it's the way that you do it.
It's a style you go about doing things.
It's inverting the problem.
It's the style of what you do that makes the difference.

Getting it clear is important.

The way you learn as far as I'm concerned
is every time you go to a talk
you listen not only to talk
but to the style that's done.

When you hear lectures and talks
ask yourself every time besides
what was a content?
what was the style?
what part can I adapt that technique?
why is that speech effective?
why is that a speech not effective?

It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
I've always trapped adopted philosophy,
"I will do the best I can with what I got".

If you're going to have progress there has to be change.
Change does not mean progress but progress requires change.

If the department has been doing this for 10 years the same way,
it's time you should change to find out
how to do it some other way.

You will never find other methods if you don't try other things.
Some of the ones will make them worse occasionally
but without change you will not have progress.

You need to put hooks on ideas so they can recover widely.

The onus is on you to demonstrate greatness
and then you'll get the opportunities.

Doing something really first-class and knowing you've done it
is better than anything else they could think of.

The unexamined life is not worth living.

I did something was important at least
something that I thought was important.

You've got to work on the right problem
at the right time
in the right way.

Repent your idle ways
and get down
and be somebody worth being.
