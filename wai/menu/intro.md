# Menu

Menus are used for navigation and to provide functionality
which are critical parts of web page operability.

## Criteria

- [2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)][2.4.3]
- [2.4.5 Multiple Ways (Level AA)][2.4.5]
- [2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)][2.4.7]
- [2.4.8 Location (Level AAA)][2.4.8]
- [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)][4.1.2]

## Why

Navigation menus reflect the underlying structure of websites.

- Screen reader and keyboard users
  benefit from keyboard interoperability and markup
  that allows them to operate menus in different ways.

- Users with fine motor difficulties and touch screen users
  require larger targets to click or tap on.
  In fly-out menus,
  submenus should not disappear immediately
  after the mouse has left the clickable area.

- People with limited attention or short-term memory
  benefit from clear and distinct menus with easily identifiable states,
  such as the current page.

## Terminology

- Structure:
  Mark up menus in a way
  that reflects their structure and appropriately labels them.

- Styling:
  Use commonly recognized design patterns
  to distinguish menus and the state of menu items.

- Fly-out Menus:
  Ensure fly-out (drop-down) submenus can be used appropriately
  by mouse and keyboard.

- Application Menus:
  Add specific markup and keyboard behavior to resemble desktop application menus.
