# Page Structure

## Criteria

- [1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)][1.3.1]
- [2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (Level A)][2.4.1]
- [2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)][2.4.6]
- [2.4.10 Section Headings (Level AAA)][2.4.10]

## Why

- People with cognitive and learning disabilities
  can more easily find and prioritize content on the page.

- People using screen readers
  can skip to the main content directly and navigate to sections
  that are important to them.

- Keyboard users
  can browse pages and their sections more efficiently.

- People using software that only shows the main content of a web page,
  such as people with cognitive disabilities,
  will receive better results if the page structure is correctly marked up.

- Mobile web users
  often have access to a so-called "reader" or "reading" mode
  that will only show the main content of the page
  if it is correctly marked up.

- People using certain browser plugins
  can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.

- There are additional benefits to a good, accessible page structure,
  beyond those experienced by people with disabilities.
  As an example,
  search engines can use the data to better index the content of a page.

## Terminology
