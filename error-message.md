# Error Message

## Be Informative

When writing an error message, there are two components you have to include:

- What happened
- How to fix it

Claiming that there has been an error or mistake without explaining
how to resolve it leaves the user without direction.

An example would be telling a user, "Couldn't rename file"
without telling them what to do next.

Telling the user what to do without explaining why there was an error
might leave them confused about what they're even fixing.
In the scenario above, this might look like saying,
"Please try another name", without any explaination.
Now they don't know what was wrong with the name they chose and might even retry it.

A good error message would read,
"There's already a file with that name. Please try another name."
Now they know what to do and how to go about it.

Before you can write an informative error message,
you need to understand the situation yourself.
Start by asking yourself what has gone wrong,
how it's gone wrong, whether it's a user or system error and how to fix it.

Some errors the operating system may control,
so it's also worth asking if it's something you can change.

## Provide a Solution

You must always provide a solution to the error at hand.
Otherwise, the user's frustration will grow
as they either waste their time trying to discover the answer on their own or give up.

Imagine a scenario where a user enters an invalid symbol in their username
while trying to create an account.
Instead of reminding them of the symbols they can use or
sharing that it's an issue with the username,
your message reads, "You can't create an account".
What are they supposed to do with that but leave?

When providing solutions, it is possible for there to be more than one option.
For instance, a 404 error may be from a typo, moved content or deleted content.
A useful 404 error page may encourage users to check their link spelling or
take an alternative route to find the content they are looking for.

## Speak the Same Language

As with all UX writing or copywriting,
you want to speak the same language as your audience.
This means removing jargon or technical teams.
You can be explicit about the error and what to do,
but users can't follow your directions if they can't understand them.

A common issue among error messages
is the use of error codes that users don't have a background in.

### Be Concise

No one wants to read an essay for most things - let alone to fix an error.
It's a known fact that people skim where they can.
Your users want to get to the point,
and your error message copy should help.

Writing shorter error messages will also increase your users understanding.
A study by the American Press Institute shows that
readers understand 100% of a message with eight words
but only 90% of a message with 14 words.
Worse yet, at 43 words, comprehension drops to a mere 10%.

When you do cut words, make sure that you still get the point across.
Remove everything the user doesn't need to know,
but keep necessary information.
The goal is to be precise and concise.

## Let Them Choose the Level of Disclosure

On the topic of being concise and speaking your user's language,
It's true that most won't understand the technical information behind a system error.
Regardless, it's nice to give the users
who might find this information beneficial the opportunity to access it.
You can do this with progressive disclosure techniques.

Progressive disclosure is when you add a "show more" or "learn more" link
or drop-down option that reveals more information.
This allows users interested in the details to view them without
overwhelming those who aren't interested.

## Take the Blame (Or Don't Assign it)

It's human nature to defend oneself,
so it's best not to offend users from the get-go.
We're talking about accusing users of causing the error at hand.
Even if the user causes the error,
you'll provide a better user experience by not pointing fingers.
This means taking the blame or not assigning it at all.

You can prevent accusatory language by focusing on the solution
instead of the user action that caused the error.
For example, your login error message can say,
"That password doesn't match. Please try again," instead of,
"The password you entered is incorrect."

## Be Gentle

WARNING: NO ONE LIKES BEING YELLED AT!

And yet, people often use all uppercase letters
or exclamation points to convey importance.
Instead, it can come across as aggressive or
heighten the user's stress about the error.
When dealing with what may already be a frustrating situation for your user,
be more gentle.

## Use Positive Language

Using positive language when conveying errors can help soothe and guide your users,
whereas negative language makes the scenario feel uncomfortable.
Notice how "use positive language" sounds nicer than "avoid negative language"
or how "be gentie" is more pleasant than "don't be aggressive".

Prioritizing the solution over the problem can help.
For example, a form with an invlid zip code can say:

- The form has errors: You entered an incorrect zip code.
  Or
- Please enter a valid zip code for your state.

Which would you prefer? We're guessing the latter.
As long as you remain clear,
given your langauge a positive makeover can make errors less upsetting.

## Use Your Brand Voice

Your brand is the core of your company,
and it's intended to prevail in all areas.
Write error messages in your brand voice
to help contribute to a seamless experience
that makes the error feel like less of an interruption.
Of course, you want to keep the tone consistent with the user's emotional experience.
A fun brand can create a more playful error message so long as it remains helpful
and doesn't make the user feel like you're not taking the problem seriously.
Humorous error messages can relieve tension or frustrate the user more.
It all depends on context.

Some businesses replace generic error messages with creative alternatives.
Google provides an offline game that users can play when disconnected from the internet.
Medium, a publishing platform,
uses its 404 Page Not Found error to say,
"You can find (just about) anything on Medium - apparently even a page that doesn't exist."
and links to intriguing articles about being lost.

## Be a Friend, Not a Robot

It's easy when conveying system erros to turn into a robot,
but the best thing you can do is fight for your humanity.
Making your error messages human and friendly humanizes the brand
and makes it feel more like you care.
Users prefer getting help from a person,
and being friendly can remove frustration and generate understanding.

## Make CTAs Clear

Depending on the content of your error message,
you may need a call to action button (CTA) that guides the user,
one that dismisses the message or none at all.

If you do use a CTA button, make it clear what the button does.
Buttons like "yes", "no" or "okay" might be too vague
if not set up by the descriptive text.
You may also have more than one CTA,
at which point you'll want to ensure that
the user can distinguish between the results of each.

When writing an error message CTA,
a good rule of thumb is to use the same text on the button that you do in the description.
For instance, don't say "erase" in the description
and then write "delete" on the corresponding action button.

## Account for Timing

Timing is another important element of how to make an error message.
Will it be immediate? In post?
The timing of an error message can be the difference between a helpful hint
and an irritating occurrence.

More often than not, real-time alerts are more helpful.
Picture filling out a form.
You make a spelling error, and immediately after,
red text appears next to the box asking you to include the missing element.
Or, you fill out the form,
hit submit and get a list of red errors to correct.
Generally, user prefer the former.

## Be Smart About Colors

Color is also a design element,
but if you're writing for UX, you should work with the UX designer
to ensure proper representation of error messages.
