# Option

An option is the right to buy a stock (or other asset)
at a specified price by a specific time.

Stock options trade on a public exchange.

An option has a fixed life,
with a specific expiration date,
after which its value is settled among investors
and the option ceases to exist.
The value of an option tends to decline over time,
all else equal, and so it's what is called a wasting asset.
