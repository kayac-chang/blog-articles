## Create unique, accurate page titles.

A title element tells both users and search engines  
what the topic of a particular page is.
Place the title element within the head element of the HTML document,
and create unique text for each page on your site.

## Control your title links and snippets in search results

If your document appears in a search results page,
the contents of the title element may appear as the title link for the search result.

### Home page

The title element for your homepage can list the name of your website or business,
and could include other bits of important information
like the physical location of the business or maybe a few of its main focuses of offerings.

## Accurately describe the page's content

Choose title text that reads naturally and effectively communicates the topic of the page's content.

### Avoid

- Avoid using text in the title element that has no relation to the content on the page.
- Avoid using default or vague text like "Untitled" or "New Page 1".

## Create unique title elements for each page

Make sure each page on your site has unique text in the title element,
which helps Google know how the page is distinct from the others on your site.

If your site uses separate mobile pages,
remember to use descriptive text in the title elements on the mobile versions too.

### Avoid

- Avoid using a single title in all title elements across your site's pages or a large group of pages.

## Use brief, but descriptive title elements

title elements can be both short and informative.  
If the text in the title element is too long or otherwise deemed less relevant,  
Google may show only a portion of the text in your title element,  
or a title link that's automatically generated in the search result.

### Avoid

- Avoid using extremely lengthy text in title elements that are unhelpful to users.
- Avoid stuffing unneeded keywords in your title element.
