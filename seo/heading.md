# Heading

## Use heading tags to emphasize important text

Use meaningful headings to indicate important topics,  
and help create a hierarchical structure for your content,  
making it easier for users to navigate through your document.

## Imagine you're writing an outline

Similar to writing an outline for a large paper,  
put some through into what the main points
and sub-points of the content on the page will be
and decide where to use heading tags appropriately.

### Avoid

- Avoid placing text in heading tags that wouldn't be helpful in defining the structure of the page.
- Avoid using tags where other tag like em and strong may be more appropriate.
- Avoid erratically moving from one heading tag size to another.

## Use headings sparingly across the page

Use heading tags where it makes sense.
Too many heading tags on a page can make it hard for users to scan the content
and determine where one topic ends and another begins.

### Avoid

- Avoid excessive use of heading tags on a page.
- Very long headings.
- Using heading tags only for styling text and not presenting structure.
