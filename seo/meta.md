## Use the meta description tag

A page's meta description tag gives Google
and other search engines a summary of what the page is about.

A page's title may be a few words or a phrase,  
whereas a page's meta description tag might be a sentence or two or even a short paragraph.
Like the title element, the meta description tag
is placed within the head element of your HTML document.

## What are the merits of meta description tags?

Meta description tags are important
because Google might use them as snippets for your pages in Google Search results.
Note that we say "might"
because Google may choose to use a relevant section of your page's visible text
if it does a good job of matching up with a user's query.
Adding meta description tags to each of your pages is always a good practice
in case Google cannot find a good selection of text to use in the snippet.

## Accurately summarize the page content

Write a description that would both inform and interest users  
if they saw your meta description tag as a snippet in a search result.
While there's no minimal or maximal length for the text in a description meta tag,
we recommend making sure that it's long enough to be fully shown in Search
(note that users may see different sized snippets depending on how and where they search),
and contains all the relevant information users would need to determine
whether the page will be useful and relevant to them.

### Avoid

- avoid writing a meta description tag that has no relation to the content on the page.
- avoid using generic descriptions like "This is a web page" or "Page about baseball cards".
- avoid filling the description with only keywords.
- avoid copying and pasting the entire content of the document into the meta description tag.

## Use unique descriptions for each page

Having a different meta description tag for each page helps both users and Google,  
especially in searches where users may bring up multiple pages on your domain
(for example, searches using the site: operator).

If your site has thousands or even millions of pages,  
hand-crafting meta description tags probably isn't feasible.
In this case, you could automatically generate meta description tags based on each page's content.

### Avoid

- avoid using a single meta description tag across all of your site's pages or a large group of pages.
