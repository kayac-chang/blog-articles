# Optimize your images

## Use HTML images

Use HTML image elements to embed images in your content.

## Use the HTML <img> or <picture> elements

Semantic HTML markup helps crawlers find and process images.
By using the <picture> element you can also specify multiple options
for different screen sizes for responsive images.
You might also use the loading="lazy" attribute on images
to make your page load faster for your users.

### Avoid

- Avoid using css to display images that you want us to index.

## Use the alt attribute

Provide a descriptive filename and alt attribute description for images.
The alt attribute allows you to specify alternative text for the image
if it cannot be displayed for some reason.

Why use this attribute?
if a user is viewing your site using assistive technologies,
such as a screen reader,
the contents of the alt attribute provide information about the picture.

Another reason is that if you're using an image as a link,
the alt text for that image will be treated similarly to the anchor text of a text link.
However, we don't recommend using too many images for links in your site's navigation
when text links could serve the same purpose.
Lastly, optimizing your image filenames
and alt text makes it easier for image search projects like Google Images
to better understand your images.

## Use brief but descriptive filenames and alt text

Like many of the other parts of the page targeted for optimization,
filenames and alt text are best when they're short, but descriptive.

### Avoid

- Avoid using generic filenames like image1.jpg, pic.gif, 1.jpg when possible-
  if your site has thousands of images
  you might want to consider automating the naming of the images.
- Avoid Writing extremely lengthy filenames.
- Avoid Stuffing keywords into alt text or copying and pasting entire sentences.

## Supply alt text when using images as links

If you do decide to use an image as a link,
filling out its alt text helps Google understand more about the page you're linking to.
Imagine that you're writing anchor text for a text link.

### Avoid

- Avoid Writing excessively long alt text that would be considered spammy.
- Avoid using only image links for your site's navigation.

## Help Search engines find your images

An Image sitemap can provide Google with more information about the images found on your site.
This increases the likelihood that your images can be found in Google Image results.
The structure of this file is similar to the XML sitemap file for your web pages.

## Use standard image formats

Use commonly supported filetypes;
most browsers support JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and WebP image formats.
It's also a good idea to have the extension of your filename match with the file type.
