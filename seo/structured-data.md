# Add structured data markup

Structured data is code that you can add to your site's pages
to describe your content to search engines,
so they can better understand what's on your pages.

Search engines can use this understanding
to display your content in useful (and eye-catching) ways in search results.
That, in turn, can help you attract just the right kind of customers for your business.

For example, if you've got an online store and mark up an individual product page,
this helps us understand that the page features a bike, its price, and customer reviews.
We may display that information in the sippet for search results for relevant queries.
We call these rich results.

In addition to using structured data markup for rich results,
we may use it to serve relevant results in other formats.
For instance, if you've got a brick-and-mortar store,
marking up the opening hours allows your potential customers
to find you exactly when they need you,
and inform them if your store is open/closed at the time of searching.

You can mark up many business-relevant entities:

- Products you're selling
- Business location
- Videos about your products or business
- Opening hours
- Events listings
- Recipes
- Your company logo, and many more

We recommend that you use structured data
with any of the supported notations markup to describe your content.
You can add the markup to the HTML code to your pages,
or use tools like Data Highlighter and Markup Helper.

## Check your markup using the Rich Results Test

once you've marked up your content,  
you can use the Google Rich Results test to make sure that
there are no mistakes in the implementation.

You can either enter the URL where the content is,
or copy the actual HTML which includes the markup.

### Avoid

- Avoid using invalid markup.

## Use Data Highlighter and Markup Helper

If you want to give structured markup a try without changing the source code of your site,
you can use Data Highlighter,
which is a tool integrated in Search Console
that supports a subset of content types.

If you'd like to get the markup code ready to copy and paste to your page,
try the Markup Helper.

### Avoid

- Avoid changing the source code of your site when you are unsure about implementing markup.

## Keep track of how your marked up pages are doing

The various Rich result reports in Search Console shows you
how many pages on your site we've detected with a specific type of markup,
how many times they appeared in search results,
and how many times people clicked on them over the past 90 days.
It also shows any errors we've detected.

### Avoid

- Avoid adding markup data which is not visible to users.
- Avoid creating fake reviews or adding irrelevant markups.

## Manage your appearance in Google Search Results

Correct structured data on your pages also makes your page eligible
for many special features in Google Search results,
including review stars, fancy decorated results, and more.
