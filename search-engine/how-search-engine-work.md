# How Search Engine Work

1. Crawling

Scour the Internet for content, looking over the code/content for each URL they find.

2. Indexing

Store and organize the content found during the crawling process.
Once a page is in the index,
it's in the running to be displayed as a result to relevant queries.

3. Ranking

Provide the pieces of content that will best answer a searcher's query,
which means that results are ordered by most relevant to least relevant

## What is search engine crawling

Crawling is the discovery process
in which search engines send out a team of robots (known as crawling or spiders)
to find new and updated content.
Content can vary - it could be a webpage, an image, a video, a PDF, etc.
but regardless of the format, content is discovered by links.

Googlebot starts out by fetching a few web pages,
and then follows the links on those webpages to find new URLs.
