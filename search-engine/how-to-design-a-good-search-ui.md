# How to Design a Good Search UI

If users don't use your search a lot,
it's often because the search user interface is poorly designed.

Here are the top guidelines for
how to show the search feature on both desktop and mobile.

## Why search

Some designers wonder whether a search feature on each website is necessary.
Especially if the site has a lot of contnet, or unhelpful navigation.

if you look at your site analytics, and see search is not used,
don't immediately conclude that people don't want to search,
while it may be true,
the reason could also be that
the people don't see the search function.
lack of use may be due to the frontend search design.

## Consider

- Offer search at the top of all pages on the site.
- Make it an empty field with no prompt text within.
  Because the text can make the field less visible.
  The text also disappears when user's click in the field
- Collapsing search under a magnifying glass on desktop,
  decreases searches visibility.
  The icon is too small in proportion to the size of the page.
- Another issue with the magnifying glass on desktop,
  is that users must click to expose the search field,
  before they can type a query.
  Introducing unnecessary interaction costs.
- On mobile devices, screen real estate is the challenge.
  To help you make the right trade off,
  study how important search is to user success on your site.
  And if it's highly important,
  use the space to offer an empty search field.
- Otherwise, it's probably worth it to collapse search
  under a magnifying glass icon.
  so you can dedicate more screen real estate,
  to your important content.
